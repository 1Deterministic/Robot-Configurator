# This file is a template on how to use files on Robot Configurator
#
# Pass this file as a parameter to use it
# It will not be used automatically
#
# The programs listed here will be installed in order
# Keep that in mind to install dependencies first
#
# Use # at the start of a line to ignore it
# Remove # from the start of a line to activate it
#
# You can leave unsupported programs by your platform for 
# installation, they will be ignored automatically
#
# So if you use, for instance, ./robotconfigurator.exe "/path/to/template.txt"
# All the programs below will be installed (if supported) on the exact same order
